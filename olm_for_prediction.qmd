## Agenda

-   What are Ordinal Longitudinal Mults-States Models?

-   Why using OLM?

-   Main Challenges

-   From Unified to a Richer Jargon

-   Outcomes

-   Probabilities

## Outcomes

## State Occupancy

### Absorbing State: Prevalence = Cumulative-Incidence

### Non-Absorbing State: Prevalence \<= Cumulative-Incidence

## Probabilities

### State-Transition Probability

### State-Occupancy Probability

### State-Visit Probability
